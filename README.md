# CloudTrip-Homework ‚úàÔ∏è

CloudTrip-Homework is a C#/.NET-based REST API that aggregates flight data from multiple (mock) providers, offering search, filtering, sorting, and booking functionalities. Built with scalability in mind, it includes caching, logging, and a standardized response format.

Features:

‚úÖ Aggregates flight data from multiple sources (mock providers)

‚úÖ Supports filtering (date, price, stops, airline) and sorting

‚úÖ Simulates flight booking requests

‚úÖ Implements caching for performance optimization

‚úÖ Logs all API requests for future analysis

‚úÖ Designed following RESTful principles with OpenAPI documentation

This project is a home assignment, showcasing clean architecture and best practices in API development.

# Architecture & Progress Overview

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

- **Authentication API**  
  Endpoints for user registration and JWT-based authentication.

- **Client App (Angular)**  
  A basic client-side project scaffolded for future development and testing of authentication and data filtering features.

- **Mocked Flight Providers**  
  Two independent mock providers simulating integration with external flight data systems.  
  Each provider exposes its own models and endpoint structure, mimicking real-world inconsistency between APIs.

- **Result Caching**  
  In-memory caching using Redis for flight data from providers to improve response times and reduce provider load.  
  *Note:* No distributed lock is currently implemented to manage cache updates in horizontally scaled scenarios.

- **Adapter Pattern**  
  Adapters are used to normalize and integrate diverse provider response models without forcing a shared contract.

- **Layered Architecture**  
  The system is divided into multiple layers:
  - `Web` ‚Äì API endpoints and client app.
  - `Application` ‚Äì Shared DTOs and minimal contracts between layers.
  - `Domain` ‚Äì Business logic layer.
  - `Infrastructure` ‚Äì Data access (MongoDB, Redis), provider integrations.

- **Clean Code Practices**  
  Implementation classes are marked `internal` to encapsulate details and `sealed` to improve runtime performance where inheritance is not needed.

## üîú Planned Improvements

- **Booking API**  
  Add functionality to allow authenticated users to book flights.

- **Client-side Authentication Flow**  
  Implement login flow and ability to filter/search flights via UI.

- **Logging**  
  Integrate Serilog for structured, performant logging.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**  
  Add automated build and deployment processes.

- **Unit testing**  
  Implement project with tests that covered business logic.

## üîé Notes

- **Configuration Management**  
  Configuration values (e.g., secrets, connection strings) are currently hardcoded for development speed. In production, these should be externalized via configuration files or secret management.

- **Interface Placement**  
  Interfaces are currently located alongside their consumers (e.g., repositories, services) instead of a dedicated shared layer. This can be improved later for clearer separation of concerns.

- **Scalability Considerations**  
  Redis caching is in place, but distributed locking and cache invalidation are not yet implemented for scaled environments.
